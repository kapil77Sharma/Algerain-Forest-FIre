# Algerain-Forest-Fire
This project focuses on predicting forest fires in two regions of Algeria, Bejaia in the northeast and Sidi Bel-abbes in the northwest. The dataset includes records spanning from June 2012 to September 2012, with 244 instances categorized as either "fire" or "not fire." With 11 attributes and one output attribute (class), we employ various machine learning techniques, including linear regression, Lasso, Ridge, and cross-validation, for hyperparameter tuning. This enables us to build a robust predictive model for forest fire occurrences in these regions.

Dataset Information:

Regions: Bejaia (northeast) and Sidi Bel-abbes (northwest) in Algeria.
Instances: 244 instances in total, with 122 instances for each region.
Period: Data recorded from June 2012 to September 2012.
Attributes: 11 attributes used for prediction.
Output Attribute: Binary classification into "fire" (138 instances) and "not fire" (106 instances).
Key Components:

Data Preprocessing: Data cleaning, handling missing values, and attribute encoding.
Linear Regression: Applying linear regression models for predictive analysis.
Lasso and Ridge: Utilizing Lasso and Ridge regression for enhanced prediction.
Cross-Validation: Employing cross-validation techniques for hyperparameter tuning.
Objective:
The main objective of this project is to create a predictive model for forest fire occurrences in the Bejaia and Sidi Bel-abbes regions of Algeria. By utilizing multiple regression techniques and cross-validation, we aim to provide a robust and accurate predictive tool for assessing the risk of forest fires in these areas during the specified time period.
